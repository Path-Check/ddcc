This implementation guide provides implementation resources and guidance in support of applying the WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience:

[WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/anc-positive-pregnancy-experience/en/)

This implementation guide is part of the WHO Smart Guidelines approach to support countries to integrate WHO global data and health recommendations into digital systems accurately and consistently. This new approach to global health in the digital age beings with maternal health and the launch of the [WHO Smart Antenatal Care Guidelines](https://www.srhr.org/antenatalcare/)

This guide is prepared to facilitate digital implementation of WHO ANC guidelines by providing FHIR-based computable representations of and implementation guidance for using the key components of the WHO ANC digital adaptation kit (DAK):

* Health Interventions & Recommendations
* Generic Personas
* User Scenarios
* Business Processes & Workflows
* Core Data Elements
* Decision Support Logic
* Indicators & Monitoring
* Functional & Non-functional Requirements

Note that the content of this implementation guide is draft material that has not yet been tested or validated for use in production environments.

Note that this is a working draft currently in progress, and subject to change without notice. The current focus is on representation of generic personas, data elements, decision support logic, and indicators.

Generic personas are largely completed, and represented as profiles of the appropriate FHIR resource.

Data elements overall are in progress, but largely complete for the following activity:

* [ANC.B10 - Counselling & treatment](documentation.html#data-elements)

Decision support logic overall is in progress, but largely complete for the following Smart Guideline Decision Tables:

* [ANC.DT.07 - Ultrasound scan](anc-recommendation-b2-4.html)
* [ANC.DT.08 - HIV testing](PlanDefinition-ANCDT08.html)
* [ANC.DT.15 - Behaviour counselling](PlanDefinition-ANCDT15.html)
* [ANC.DT.25 - Anaemia testing](anc-recommendation-b1-1.html) & [Iron and folic acid supplements](anc-recommendation-a2.html)
* [ANC.DT.38 - Deworming & malaria prophylaxis](PlanDefinition-ANCDT38.html)
